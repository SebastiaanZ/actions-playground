      # While the `review-approval-check` workflow should label PRs that have
      # just been opened, I've noticed that the `labeled` event type is not
      # always triggered so soon after opening a PR. That's why we also explicitly
      # fail the check after opening a PR, as we don't have reviews yet at that
      # point.
